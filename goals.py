# Using:
  # OpenCV
  # Darknet (YOLO)
  # Matplotlib 3D
  # PyMesh

# Requirements:
  # live camera
  # hand
  # some 3D object already online

# Overall Goals:
  # using OpenCV's hand-tracking software (along with other relevant libraries)
  # use hand position and orientation to move a 3D object
  # this 3D object can be 3D graph data, or some object that requires 3D visualization
  # object will change position and orientation according to hand positions/orientations
  # this includes turning your hand around, closing your fingers, showing fingers, etc.
